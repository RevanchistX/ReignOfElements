# Mechanics (Somatic/Material Casting)
- `Right Mouse Button` on an `Elemental Pillar` to absorb the element
> - this should be a channeled ability
- `Left Mouse Button` multiple times to cast a spell
> - this should be a motion rather than clicking on the screen
> - tutorial used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgmfZRllpzs
- Hold `CTRL` to open the `Spellbook`
- Input the spell sequence to cast the spell
> "sequence" can be called "somatic mnemonic"
